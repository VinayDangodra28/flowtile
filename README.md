# FlowTile

**FlowTile** is a web-based tool for creating seamless, infinitely repeating patterns. It allows precise control over shapes, positioning, and duplication logic to build patterns that can tile across any surface—such as walls, fabrics, packaging, or digital media.

- Seamless edge behavior — shapes connect accurately across tile boundaries
- Basic shape tools for structured design (rectangles, circles, triangles, etc.)
- Image upload support for incorporating custom assets
- Layer management and duplication controls
- Export patterns as PNG or SVG
- Import/export project files for saving and editing work
